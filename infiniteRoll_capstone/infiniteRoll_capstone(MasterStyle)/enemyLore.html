        A fearsome yet beautiful creature to behold. This creature has some strange abilities, too! 
        It enjoys running or talking walks on top of lakes and rivers, but he never falls in. 
        This is because once its foot comes in contact with the surface of the water, the water instantly freezes. 
        Allowing the fox to safely travel across any boy of water.
