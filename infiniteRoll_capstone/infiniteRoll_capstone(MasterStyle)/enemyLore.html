          Just a common bandit. A ruffian like this only wants one thing, gold.
          Also possibly to have been loved more as a child, but we aren't here
          to get into his issues.

          A spatula that is also part vampire? Well this is bizzare. 
          Count spatula was once a normal spatula that was enchanted to come to life one day, 
          but he had a terrible encounter with a vampire one faithful night. And so he was cursed, or so the story goes...

          Ents are very mysterious creatures to say the least. They are one with nature,
          and only appear in areas that have fallen out of balance.
          What could bring them here though? What power could cause so many ents 
          to converge and be so aggresive?

          Gasp! What's that creeping the bushes? Oh, its just a goblin.
          Goblins are common enemies that serve under the ruthless Goblin King.
          Not much can be said about goblins other then they like shiny objects and
          they sometimes need a good kick in the rear.

          The ruthless king of all goblins, the Goblin King will stop at nothing to destroy everything in it's path.
          While the Goblin King is a very dangerous entity, even he fears what lies beyond his kingdom...
          or possibly even in his kingdom?

          A fearsome yet beautiful creature to behold. 
          This creature has some strange abilities, too! 
          It enjoys running or taking walks on top of lakes and rivers, but he never falls in. 
          This is because once its foot comes in contact with the surface of the water, the water instantly freezes. 
          Allowing the fox to safely travel across any body of water.

          The wolf may seem pretty vanilla compared to other beasts that lurk in the woods,
          but it is very dangerous still. Usually wolves hunt in packs, but for some reason
          they only appear solo around here. Maybe something even more powerful has caused their numbers
          to shrink?

          Wow! A mimic merchant?! That is exactly what Chester is.
          While most mimics tend to trick adventurers into their doom,
          Chester has found that he gets much more from working with adventurers,
          instead of eating them. You may encouter this merchant lots of times
          during your adventures, maybe you could stop and tell him stories
          of magical oubliettes and dangerous beasts.

          Steve, a powerful and ancient entity. No one has ever seen Steve in person, and lived to tell the tale that is.
          Some folks have claimed that he has left them gifts, telling them that he will fight them once they have gained more
          power.
