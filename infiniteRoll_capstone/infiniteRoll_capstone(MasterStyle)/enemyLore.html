          This poor abandoned pet has suffered for years, grieving and longing over the life that they had with their past ower. 
          Inside it holds a grudge that has been waiting for years to come out. But be careful, these creatures attack those who remind
          them of their owners.

          A spatula that is also part vampire? well this is bizzare. 
          Count spatula was once a normal spatula that was enchanted to come to life one day, 
          but he had a terrible encounter with a vampire one faithful night. And so he was cursed, or so the story goes...

          Gasp! What's that creeping the bushes? Oh, its just a goblin.
          Goblins are common enemies that serve under the ruthless Goblin King.
          Not much can be said about goblins other then they like shiny objects and
          they sometimes need a good kick in the rear

          The ruthless king of all goblins, the Goblin King will stop at nothing to destroy everything in it's path.
          While the Goblin King is a very dangerous entity, even he fears what lies beyond his kingdom...
          or possibly even in his kingdom?

          A fearsome yet beautiful creature to behold. 
          This creature has some strange abilities, too! 
          It enjoys running or talking walks on top of lakes and rivers, but he never falls in. 
          This is because once its foot comes in contact with the surface of the water, the water instantly freezes. 
          Allowing the fox to safely travel across any boy of water.
