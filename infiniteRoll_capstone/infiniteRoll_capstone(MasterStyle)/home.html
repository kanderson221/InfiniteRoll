    Welcome to the world of Infinite Roll! This is a game designed to test the limits of how far you an get on your own in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. You will construct a character, and roll for all of your stats (or if you didn't roll well, you may just need to take a standard array). This land maybe unforgiving, but you could have the makings of a true hero! Do you think you're up to the challenge? Lets begin.
